Python Operators
comments

In Python programming, Operators in general are used to perform operations on values and variables.

    Operators: Special symbols like -, + , * , /, etc.
    Operands: Value on which the operator is applied.

Arithmetic Operators

Python Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

In Python 3.x the result of division is a floating-point while in Python 2.x division of 2 integers was an integer. To obtain an integer result in Python 3.x floored (// integer) is used.

# Variables

a = 15

b = 4

​

# Addition

print("Addition:", a + b)  

​

# Subtraction

print("Subtraction:", a - b) 

​

# Multiplication

print("Multiplication:", a * b)  

​

# Division

print("Division:", a / b) 

​

# Floor Division

print("Floor Division:", a // b)  

​

# Modulus

print("Modulus:", a % b) 

​

# Exponentiation

print("Exponentiation:", a ** b)


Output

Addition: 19
Subtraction: 11
Multiplication: 60
Division: 3.75
Floor Division: 3
Modulus: 3
Exponentiation: 50625

    Note: Refer to Differences between / and //.

Comparison Operators

In Python, Comparison (or Relational) operators compares values. It either returns True or False according to the condition.

a = 13

b = 33

​

print(a > b)

print(a < b)

print(a == b)

print(a != b)

print(a >= b)

print(a <= b)


Output

False
True
False
True
False
True

Logical Operators

Python Logical operators perform Logical AND, Logical OR and Logical NOT operations. It is used to combine conditional statements.

The precedence of Logical Operators in Python is as follows:

    Logical not
    logical and
    logical or

a = True

b = False

print(a and b)

print(a or b)

print(not a)


Output

False
True
False

Bitwise Operators

Python Bitwise operators act on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations. These are used to operate on binary numbers.

Bitwise Operators in Python are as follows:

    Bitwise NOT
    Bitwise Shift
    Bitwise AND
    Bitwise XOR
    Bitwise OR

a = 10

b = 4

​

print(a & b)

print(a | b)

print(~a)

print(a ^ b)

print(a >> 2)

print(a << 2)


Output

0
14
-11
14
2
40

Assignment Operators

Python Assignment operators are used to assign values to the variables. This operator is used to assign the value of the right side of the expression to the left side operand.
Example

a = 10

b = a

print(b)

b += a

print(b)

b -= a

print(b)

b *= a

print(b)

b <<= a

print(b)


Output

10
20
10
100
102400

Identity Operators

In Python, is and is not are the identity operators both are used to check if two values are located on the same part of the memory. Two variables that are equal do not imply that they are identical. 

    is          True if the operands are identical 
    is not      True if the operands are not identical 

a = 10

b = 20

c = a

​

print(a is not b)

print(a is c)


Output

True
True

Membership Operators

In Python, in and not in are the membership operators that are used to test whether a value or variable is in a sequence.

    in            True if value is found in the sequence
    not in        True if value is not found in the sequence

x = 24

y = 20

list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

​

if (x not in list):

    print("x is NOT present in given list")

else:

    print("x is present in given list")

​

if (y in list):

    print("y is present in given list")

else:

    print("y is NOT present in given list")


Output

x is NOT present in given list
y is present in given list

Ternary Operator

in Python, Ternary operators also known as conditional expressions are operators that evaluate something based on a condition being true or false. It was added to Python in version 2.5. 

It simply allows testing a condition in a single line replacing the multiline if-else, making the code compact.

    Syntax :  [on_true] if [expression] else [on_false] 

a, b = 10, 20

min = a if a < b else b

​

print(min)


Output

10

Precedence and Associativity of Operators

In Python, Operator precedence and associativity determine the priorities of the operator.
Operator Precedence

This is used in an expression with more than one operator with different precedence to determine which operation to perform first.

expr = 10 + 20 * 30

print(expr)

name = "Alex"

age = 0

​

if name == "Alex" or name == "John" and age >= 2:

    print("Hello! Welcome.")

else:

    print("Good Bye!!")


Output

610
Hello! Welcome.

Operator Associativity

If an expression contains two or more operators with the same precedence then Operator Associativity is used to determine. It can either be Left to Right or from Right to Left.

print(100 / 10 * 10)

print(5 - 2 + 3)

print(5 - (2 + 3))

print(2 ** 3 ** 2)


Output

100.0
6
0
512
