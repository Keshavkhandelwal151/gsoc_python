Python String
comments

In Python, a string is a sequence of characters written inside quotes. It can include letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.

    Python does not have a separate character type.
    A single character is treated as a string of length one.
    Strings are commonly used for text handling and manipulation.

Creating a String

Strings can be created using either single ('...') or double ("...") quotes. Both behave the same.
Example: Creating two equivalent strings one with single and other with double quotes.

s1 = 'GfG'  # single quote

s2 = "GfG"  # double quote

print(s1)

print(s2)


Output

GfG
GfG

Multi-line Strings

Use triple quotes ('''...''' ) or ( """...""") for strings that span multiple lines. Newlines are preserved.
Example: Define and print multi-line strings using both styles.

s = """I am Learning

Python String on GeeksforGeeks"""

print(s)

​

s = '''I'm a 

Geek'''

print(s)


Output

I am Learning
Python String on GeeksforGeeks
I'm a 
Geek

Accessing characters in String

Strings are indexed sequences. Positive indices start at 0 from the left; negative indices start at -1 from the right as represented in below image:

Indices of string in reverse

Example 1: Access specific characters through positive indexing.

s = "GeeksforGeeks"

print(s[0])   # first character

print(s[4])   # 5th character


Output

G
s

    Note: Accessing an index out of range will cause an IndexError. Only integers are allowed as indices and using a float or other types will result in a TypeError.

Example 2: Read characters from the end using negative indices.

s = "GeeksforGeeks"

print(s[-10])   # 3rd character

print(s[-5])    # 5th character from end


Output

k
G

String Slicing

Slicing is a way to extract a portion of a string by specifying the start and end indexes. The syntax for slicing is string[start:end], where start starting index and end is stopping index (excluded).
Example: In this example we are slicing through range and reversing a string.

s = "GeeksforGeeks"

print(s[1:4])    # characters from index 1 to 3

print(s[:3])     # from start to index 2

print(s[3:])     # from index 3 to end

print(s[::-1])   # reverse string


Output

eek
Gee
ksforGeeks
skeeGrofskeeG

String Iteration

Strings are iterable; you can loop through characters one by one.

Example: Here, it print each character on its own line.

s = "Python"

for char in s:

    print(char)


Output

P
y
t
h
o
n

Explanation: for loop pulls characters in order and each iteration prints the next character.
String Immutability

Strings are immutable, which means that they cannot be changed after they are created. If we need to manipulate strings then we can use methods like concatenation, slicing or formatting to create new strings based on original.
Example: In this example we are changing first character by building a new string.

s = "geeksforGeeks"

s = "G" + s[1:]   # create new string

print(s)


Output

GeeksforGeeks

Deleting a String

In Python, it is not possible to delete individual characters from a string since strings are immutable. However, we can delete an entire string variable using the del keyword.
Example: Here, we are using del keyword to delete a string.

s = "GfG"
del s

    Note: After deleting the string if we try to access s then it will result in a NameError because variable no longer exists.

Updating a String

As strings are immutable, “updates” create new strings using slicing or methods such as replace().
Example: This code fix the first letter and replace a word.

s = "hello geeks"

s1 = "H" + s[1:]                   # update first character

s2 = s.replace("geeks", "GeeksforGeeks")  # replace word

print(s1)

print(s2)


Output

Hello geeks
hello GeeksforGeeks

Explanation:

    s1: slice from index 1 onward and prepend "H".
    s2: replace("geeks", "GeeksforGeeks") returns a new string.

Common String Methods

Python provides various built-in methods to manipulate strings. Below are some of the most useful methods:

1. len(): The len() function returns the total number of characters in a string (including spaces and punctuation).
Example:

s = "GeeksforGeeks"

print(len(s))


Output

13

2. upper() and lower(): upper() method converts all characters to uppercase whereas, lower() method converts all characters to lowercase.
Example:

s = "Hello World"

print(s.upper())

print(s.lower())


Output

HELLO WORLD
hello world

3. strip() and replace(): strip() removes leading and trailing whitespace from the string and replace() replaces all occurrences of a specified substring with another.
Example:

s = "   Gfg   "

print(s.strip())    

​

s = "Python is fun"

print(s.replace("fun", "awesome"))


Output

Gfg
Python is awesome

Concatenating and Repeating Strings

We can concatenate strings using + operator and repeat them using * operator.

1. Strings can be combined by using + operator.
Example: Join two words with a space.

s1 = "Hello"

s2 = "World"

print(s1 + " " + s2)


Output

Hello World

2. We can repeat a string multiple times using * operator.
Example: Repeat a greeting three times.

s = "Hello "

print(s * 3)


Output

Hello Hello Hello 

Formatting Strings

Python provides several ways to include variables inside strings.
1. Using f-strings

The simplest and most preferred way to format strings is by using f-strings.
Example: Embed variables directly using {} placeholders.

name = "Alice"

age = 22

print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")


Output

Name: Alice, Age: 22

2. Using format()

Another way to format strings is by using format() method.
Example: Use placeholders {} and pass values positionally.

s = "My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format("Alice", 22)

print(s)


Output

My name is Alice and I am 22 years old.

String Membership Testing

in keyword checks if a particular substring is present in a string.
Example: Here, we are testing for the presence of substrings.

s = "GeeksforGeeks"

print("Geeks" in s)

print("GfG" in s)


Output

True
False
